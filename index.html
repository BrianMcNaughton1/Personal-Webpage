      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Brian — a full-stack software developer who loves turning ideas into clean,
        functional, and user-friendly software. I have a solid foundation in computer science and
        hands-on experience building web applications, automating workflows, and managing
        large-scale data systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently finishing my <strong>Computer Science degree</strong> at
        <strong>California State University, Los Angeles</strong>, where I’ve maintained a
        <strong>3.9 GPA</strong> while diving deep into everything from data structures and
        algorithms to AI, web development, and cloud computing. I’m the type of person who
        enjoys learning how things work under the hood — whether that’s debugging a complex
        program or optimizing a cloud migration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been working as an <strong>IT Specialist</strong> since 2018, helping clients solve
        hardware and software issues, upgrade systems, and plan tech improvements. It’s been a
        great way to develop real-world problem-solving skills and understand how technology can
        make life easier for people.
      </p>
      <h3>Some of my favorite projects include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>sushi ordering website</strong> I built using HTML, CSS, MySQL, and Node.js,
          complete with map and email integrations to make it feel like a real product.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>cloud migration project</strong> for the Santa Barbara Public Defender, where
          I worked on automating the processing of over 100 terabytes of data — including
          transcription and facial recognition workflows to improve efficiency and data
          organization.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I’m involved with the
        <strong>Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</strong> at CSULA, helping organize
        events and workshops for students. I’m also part of
        <strong>Technical Interview Preparation for Software Engineers (TIPSE)</strong>, where I
        practice coding challenges and sharpen my problem-solving skills each week.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m curious, driven, and always looking for new ways to grow as a developer. Whether it’s
        collaborating on a new project, diving into a tough debugging session, or exploring the
        latest tech tools, I love the process of creating something that works and makes an
        impact.
