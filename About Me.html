        Hi, I’m Brian — a full-stack software developer who loves turning ideas into clean,
        functional, and user-friendly software. I have a solid foundation in computer science and
        hands-on experience building web applications, automating workflows, and managing
        large-scale data systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently finishing my <strong>Computer Science degree</strong> at
        <strong>California State University, Los Angeles</strong>, where I’ve maintained a
        <strong>3.9 GPA</strong> while diving deep into everything from data structures and
        algorithms to AI, web development, and cloud computing. I love learning how things work
        under the hood — whether that’s debugging a complex program or optimizing a cloud
        migration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been working as an <strong>IT Specialist</strong> since 2018, helping clients solve
        hardware and software issues, upgrade systems, and plan tech improvements. It’s been a
        great way to develop real-world problem-solving skills and understand how technology can
        make life easier for people.
      </p>

      <h3>Some of my favorite projects include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>sushi ordering website</strong> built with HTML, CSS, MySQL, and Node.js —
          complete with map and email integrations for a realistic user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>cloud migration project</strong> for the Santa Barbara Public Defender, where
          I worked on automating the processing of over 100 terabytes of data — including
          transcription and facial recognition workflows to improve efficiency and data
          organization.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I’m also involved with the <strong>Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</strong> at
        CSULA, helping organize events and workshops for students, and with
        <strong>Technical Interview Preparation for Software Engineers (TIPSE)</strong>, where I
        regularly practice coding challenges and problem-solving techniques.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m curious, driven, and always looking for new ways to grow as a developer. Whether it’s
        collaborating on a new project, diving into a tough debugging session, or exploring the
        latest tech tools, I love the process of creating something that works and makes an
        impact.
